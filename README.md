# slowhell.xyz

**A transmission point for recursive tools, entropic journaling, and symbolic interface design.**  
Built as a hybrid between technical portfolio and living ritual space.

## What is This?

`slowhell.xyz` is not a traditional portfolio. It's a **modular scroll-based website** structured to house:

- 🜂 Experimental APIs (like ACT, entropy scoring, bias risk detection)
- 🜃 Tools for DBT journaling and cognitive reflection
- 🜏 Interfaces that simulate terminals, REPLs, and ritual entry points
- 🝰 Poetic error handling (404s as philosophical spaces)
- 🜍 Thematic recursion via CSS, HTML, and storytelling architecture

## Structure
/index.html # Landing page (Axis) 
/about.html # Personal background and ethos 
/projects.html # Showcase of tools and experiments 
/404.html # Symbolic error handling 
/style.css # Modular styling across scrolls /docs/ # Future expansion space for technical documentation

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3
- Local-first design, deployable via GitHub Pages
- Modular CSS for unified theming
- Optional enhancements using JS for CLI simulation (in progress)

## Why It Exists

This project explores the intersection of:
- Self-reflection through code
- Mental health support through DBT logic
- Entropic modeling and symbolic computing
- The aesthetics of slow failure and patient design

It is an experiment. A sanctuary. A story that has no ending nor beginning.
