  <h1></strong>about.slowhell.xyz</strong></h1>

  <p><strong>slowhell.xyz</strong> is my transmission point, a sanctuary of decay, code, and slow rebirth. It started as a whisper in a dark loop: a place to document thoughts I couldn't say aloud, to code truths I didn't yet understand.</p>

  <p>I created <strong>slowhell.xyz</strong> as a space to build deliberately. A place where code and cognition, entropy and emotion, could sit in the same breath.</p>

  <p>I'm building software that can hold grief without crashing. Interfaces that can listen without speaking. Pages that become mirrors.</p>

  <p>I'm a student of Computer Science, a father, and a seeker drawn to the liminal spaces between software and self. I explore the intersection of AI, nueroscience, philosophy, and the art of designing rituals through interface. My name is Tyler, but here I go by @whoami.null.xyz </p>

  <p>slowhell.xyz isn't a product. It's a public notebook, a working archive of in-progress systems. You'll find entropy-based APIs, emotional journaling tools, and metaphysical experiments with terminal-style REPLs. I treat technology as a mirror. I code to reflect, not just execute.</p>
